# Kickstarting Excel

## Overview of Project
This project used Microsoft Excel to analyse data downloaded from Kickstarter's API. The data collected included information on fundraising campaigns of all different types from arround the world. The challege was to sort and filter the data to glean insights relevent to theatrical projects on the site, particularly plays.

### Purpose
The purpose of this report is to identify key factors that lead to success and failure when raising money for theatrical projects on the platform Kickstarter. The report will primarily examine two factors that may contribute to the outcomes of the fundraising campaigns; goal amount and launch date.

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
![Outcomes Based on Launch Date](/Resources/Outcomes_Based_on_Lanuch_Date_Chart.png)
This chart illustrates the outcomes of campaigns (successful, failed, or canceled) in the Theater/Plays subcategory based on the launch date of the campaign.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
![Outcomes Based on Goals](/Resources/Outcomes_vs_Goals.png)
This chart illustrates the relationship between campaign outcome and the goal amount of the campaign.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
One thing threw me for a loop was when my expected total campaign count did not match up with the sum of the table I constructed to tally successful vs unsuccessful vs canceled campaigns.

The total of the subcatagory was higher than the what my table accounted for. It took a little digging but I realized that the totals didn't match up because the table I was asked to construct didn't include all of the potential campaign outcomes. Campaigns that were still 'live' were not included in the table I constructed. Those missing campaigns were the reason for the disparency

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
Campaigns launched in the Month's of May and June have the best chance of success. Campaigns launched from the fall through winter (September to March) have the highest failure rates with campaigns launched in December have the worst outcomes of any month of the year.

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
The conclutions here are not as obvious. The chart doesn't show a single defined peak and valley. The data does have some takeaways.
Generally, the chance of success is best the lower the goal. The success rate is better than 50% for all compaigns with goals of less than $20,000. The rate of success in the lowest subgroup; goals of less than $1000 is nearly 80% and the success rate for the next subgroup; goals between $1000 and $4999, is nearly as high. 
There is also an interesting anomoly. Campaigns with a goal of between $35,000 and $45,000 had a success rate of over 50% with steap dropoffs on either side of this goal bracket.
Another conclution is that campaigns with goals of over $45k have almost no chance to succeed and creators looking to fund projects with budgets this high are better served looking for investment outside of Kickstarter.



- What are some limitations of this dataset?
The data is rather old. It covers campaigns started from 2010-2017. Better conclutions could be drawn with more recent data.



- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
 - The length of successful vs unsuccessful campaigns
 - Is there a 'magic' ratio between length of campaign and goal amount?
 - Outcomes in Great Britian vs the US
 - Outcomes among subcategories within the Theater parent group
